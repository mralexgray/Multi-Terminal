# Multi Terminal

## What is it?

A Mac OS X GUI app for performing terminal commands in multiple directories at once.

See this screenshot:

## Why?

I use this tool for managing several (30+) git repos at once.

## No really, why?

It seemed like a good idea at the time.

## Is it complete?

Of course not. It's a throw away github project. It "works for me". But needs more work to be generally useful to other people.

## TODO

* Better interaction with grid view (drag & drop, command + delete, etc etc)
* Real terminal support.
* Correct terminal history
* Zoom in/out on terminals
* "Open in Terminal"
